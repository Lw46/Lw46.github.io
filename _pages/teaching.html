## Himawari-8/9 AHI Land Surface Reflectance (LSR) Dataset  
The AHI LSR dataset can be obtained from an FTP server,  
ftp (anonymous) as:modis.cr.chiba-u.ac.jp/ichii/SEND_NEW/H8AHI/sample3

### Data description
An atmospheric correction process was performed for Band01 to 06 of the [CEReS Grid AHI](https://www.cr.chiba-u.jp/databases/GEO/H8_9/FD/index_en_V20190123.html) using the look-up table (LUT) method based on the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector (6SV) radiative transfer model (RTM) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) - European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 (EAC4). In the processing, a mean resampling method was used for the data of Band03 to generate LSRs of 0.01°. LSRs were obtained for each 10 minutes from UTC00 to 08 for 2018 and 2019 from ftp://modis.cr.chiba-u.ac.jp/ichii/SEND_NEW/H8AHI_SR/. To match the spatial resolution of the short wavelength infrared bands (Band 05 and 06), a mean down-sampling method was used for the data of Band 01 to 04 (2x2 pixels of 0.01 °corresponding to a 0.02° pixel) to resample the resolution to 0.02 °.
Cloud mask data were generated using the [Yamamoto](https://researchmap.jp/yyuhei) et al. (2018,2022) algorithm, which sets thresholds for reflectance and brightness temperature in visible and infrared band data to identify clouds. The algorithm provides a cloud mask of the FD region with a spatial resolution of 0.02°.
